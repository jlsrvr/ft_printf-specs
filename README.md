# ft_printf-specs

These are tests for my version of the printf function.

In them I try a different approach by having scripts that compile specific files, corresponding to one part of the code. The aim here is to really test each main piece of code in isolation.


This proved quite efficient and allowed me to quickly move from my first solution, building one string then printing it out, to printing characters out after each conversion.

These scripts are specific and were written in parallele of my code which can be found [here](https://github.com/jlsrvr/ft_printf).
